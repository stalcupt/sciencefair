  <h2>Calling all scientists!</h2>

  <p>
    The theme of this year's fair is <b>"The Earth"</b>, and we invite all
    students up to 8th grade to participate. For those who may want to compete
    with the chance to move on to the regional fair, the deadline to complete
    projects is <b>February 11, 2023</b> for virtual judging that week. For all
    others, the tentative deadline for completion will be <b>May 8, 2021</b>.
    Fill out the <a href="register.html">registration form</a> to sign up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Due to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the date, format, and
    location (virtual/indoors/outdoors) of the main fair in May has not been
    confirmed. The PTO will announce the fair date and location in the coming
    weeks or months. At a minimum, a public fair will be held virtually.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Please note:</strong> your project does <em>not</em> have to be
    about The Earth. Your project should be about whatever you are excited about!
  </p>
